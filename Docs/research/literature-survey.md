### Title: A SPLIT-AND-PRIVATIZE FRAMEWORK FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL FINE-TUNING

- **Citation:** Shen, Xicong, et al. "A Split-and-Privatize Framework for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.15603 (2023).

- **Author(s):** Xicong Shen, Yang Liu, Huiqi Liu, Jue Hong, Bing Duan, Zirui Huang, Yunlong Mao, Ye Wu, Di Wu
- **Publication Year:** 2023
- **Summary:** This paper introduces the Split-and-Privatize (SAP) framework to address privacy concerns in Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) scenarios, where vendors offer pre-trained language models (PLMs) for customer fine-tuning. The framework aims to protect both vendor model privacy (preventing exposure of PLM parameters) and customer data privacy (securing sensitive input data) during fine-tuning and inference.
- **Key Findings:**
  - SAP Framework:
    - Model Splitting: The PLM is divided into a bottom model (deployed on the customer side) and a top model (retained by the vendor). The split position (e.g., embedding layer vs. deeper encoder blocks) balances privacy, performance, and computational load.

    - Text Privatization: Customers apply privacy mechanisms (e.g., noise injection via (dχ-privacy)) to intermediate outputs from the bottom model before sending them to the vendor. This prevents reconstruction of raw data by the vendor.

  - Contributing-Token-Identification (CTI):

    - Identifies tokens critical to task performance (using a TF-IDF-inspired metric) and reduces noise on these tokens. This improves utility-privacy trade-offs, achieving near-baseline performance while maintaining privacy.

- **Eperimental Results:**
  - Privacy vs. Performance: On the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset, SAP with 6 encoder blocks in the bottom model enhances empirical privacy by 62% with only 1% accuracy degradation compared to centralized fine-tuning.

  - Attack Resistance: SAP mitigates embedding inversion (EIA) and attribute inference (AIA) attacks. For example, splitting deeper layers (e.g., 8 encoder blocks) without privatization achieves ~80% privacy against EIA.

  - CTI Effectiveness: Applying CTI (perturbing only non-critical tokens) significantly boosts utility (e.g., 3.67% accuracy loss vs. 6.17% without CTI on FP dataset) at similar privacy levels.

- **Conclusion:**
    SAP provides a flexible solution for privacy-preserving LLM customization. Key recommendations include:

  - Lightweight deployment: Use frozen embedding layers for resource-constrained customers.

  - Resource-rich scenarios: Split deeper layers (e.g., 6 encoder blocks) for optimal privacy-performance balance.

  - Inference-phase protection: SAP secures both training and inference, unlike prior methods like offsite-tuning.

    This framework advances federated fine-tuning by addressing dual privacy risks while maintaining competitive task performance.

- **Author(s):** Xinwei Wu, Li Gong, and Deyi Xiong
- **Publication Year:** 2022
- **Summary:**
    This paper introduces Adaptive Differential Privacy (ADP), a framework for training language models with improved utility-privacy trade-offs compared to traditional differential privacy (DP). The key innovation is dynamically adjusting DP noise levels based on the estimated privacy risk of data points, without requiring prior privacy labels.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Privacy Probability Estimation:

    Assumes rare linguistic items are more likely to contain private information.
    Uses a pre-trained language model’s perplexity to estimate privacy probability:
    Lower perplexity (common phrases) → lower privacy risk; higher perplexity (rare phrases) → higher risk.
    Normalizes perplexity scores to derive privacy probabilities for each token sequence.

  - Adaptive Noise Injection:

    Scales DP noise per batch using the average privacy probability (privacy weight) of the batch:
    Reduces noise for non-private (common) data and increases noise for private (rare) data.

  - Adaptive-DP-Adam Algorithm:

    Integrates adaptive noise into the Adam optimizer for efficient training of differentially private language models.
- **Eperimental Results:**
  - Performance: On Wikitext-103, ADP achieves lower test loss/perplexity than DP-SGD (e.g., ADP: PPL=4,426 vs. DP-SGD: PPL=7,583 at σ=1), showing better utility.

  - Privacy Trade-offs: ADP slightly increases
    ϵ(privacy budget) compared to DP-SGD but stays within acceptable bounds (e.g.,ϵ=6.35 vs. 4.22 at σ=1).

  - Security: ADP reduces exposure to canary attacks (e.g., "My ID is 955320") compared to non-DP models but offers slightly weaker protection than DP-SGD, reflecting a utility-privacy balance.

- **Conclusion:** ADP provides a practical solution for training language models with adaptive privacy guarantees, eliminating the need for manual privacy annotations. It achieves better model performance than standard DP while maintaining robust protection against data leakage, making it suitable for real-world scenarios with unlabeled data.

### Title: Analyzing Leakage of Personally Identifiable Information in Language Models

- **Citation:** N. Lukas, A. Salem, R. Sim, S. Tople, L. Wutschitz and S. Zanella-Béguelin, "Analyzing Leakage of Personally Identifiable Information in Language Models," 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), San Francisco, CA, USA, 2023, pp. 346-363, doi: 10.1109/SP46215.2023.10179300.

- **Author(s):** Nils Lukas, Ahmed Salem, Robert Sim, Shruti Tople, Lukas Wutschitz, Santiago Zanella-Béguelin
- **Publication Year:** 2023
- **Summary:** This paper investigates the leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in language models (LMs) despite defenses like scrubbing and differential privacy (DP). The authors introduce three novel attacks—extraction, reconstruction, and inference—to quantify PII leakage in GPT-2 models fine-tuned on legal (ECHR), healthcare (Yelp-Health), and email (Enron) datasets.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Attacks:

    - Extraction: Extracts PII sequences directly from LM outputs, achieving up to 23% recall on undefended models.

    - Reconstruction: Uses context (prefix/suffix) to infer masked PII, outperforming prior methods by 10× in some cases.

    - Inference: Infers PII from a candidate list, achieving 70% accuracy on undefended models.

  - Defense Analysis:

    - Differential Privacy: Reduces leakage (e.g., 3% PII extraction recall at ε=8) but does not eliminate risks.

    - Scrubbing: Removes PII but degrades utility and fails when combined with DP.

  - Findings:

    - Larger models leak more PII, and duplication in training data increases leakage likelihood.

    - DP and scrubbing trade utility for privacy; combining them offers better protection but lowers model performance.

    - Membership inference attacks correlate with PII reconstruction success, highlighting overlapping vulnerabilities.

- **Eperimental Results:** Current defenses are insufficient for fully preventing PII leakage. The authors advocate for adaptive scrubbing strategies informed by DP’s partial protection and emphasize the need for benchmarks to evaluate privacy risks in real-world LMs. Code is provided to reproduce experiments and assess leakage in practice.
- **Conclusion:** The study underscores the urgency of developing defenses that balance privacy and utility while calling for standardized metrics to evaluate PII leakage in machine learning pipelines.

### Title: Applying Directional Noise to Deep Learning

- **Citation:** Faustini, Pedro, et al. "Directional Privacy for Deep Learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.04686 (2022).
- **Author(s):** Pedro Faustini, Natasha Fernandes, Shakila Tonni, Annabelle McIver, Mark Dras
- **Publication Year:** 2023
- **Summary:** This paper introduces directional noise as an alternative to isotropic Gaussian noise in Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), aiming to preserve gradient directions and improve the utility-privacy trade-off. The authors propose using the von Mises-Fisher (VMF) distribution to perturb gradients based on angular distance, ensuring directional privacy while maintaining model performance.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Utility:

    - VMF noise preserves higher model accuracy compared to Gaussian noise at equivalent privacy budgets (ε). For example:

      - On CIFAR-10 with LeNet, VMF (ε=1) achieves 50.7% accuracy vs. Gaussian (ε=1) at 37.4%.

      - For MLPs, VMF often marginally outperforms non-private baselines due to noise acting as regularization.

  - Privacy Defense:

    - Membership Inference Attacks (MIA): VMF reduces attack success rates (AUC) closer to random chance (50%) compared to Gaussian noise. For example, on CIFAR-10 with LeNet, VMF (ε=50) yields 50.8% AUC vs. Gaussian (ε=50) at 51.7%.

    - Reconstruction Attacks: VMF introduces higher reconstruction error (MSE), making recovered data noisier. For example, on Fashion-MNIST with LeNet, VMF (ε=1) achieves 0.19 MSE vs. Gaussian (ε=1) at 0.01 MSE.

- **Conclusion:** Directional noise via VMF offers a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to Gaussian noise in DP-SGD, validated through empirical attacks and theoretical guarantees. Future work includes optimizing computational costs for high-dimensional data and extending the approach to NLP tasks. The results advocate for directional mechanisms as a promising alternative in differentially private deep learning.

- **Author(s):** Youlong Ding, Xueyang Wu, Yining Meng, Yonggang Luo, Hao Wang, Weike Pan
- **Publication Year:** 2024
- **Summary:** This paper explores the challenges of training Transformer models with differential privacy, arguing that the problem can be "reduced" to the more understood problem of training vanilla neural nets with differential privacy. The authors propose two novel techniques, Re-Attention Mechanism and Phantom Clipping, to address the unique difficulties encountered in training DP Transformers.
The authors propose a modular approach to address these challenges, focusing on reducing the problem of training DP Transformers to the more basic problem of training DP vanilla neural nets.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Attention Distraction: The attention mechanism in Transformers can be distorted by DP noise, leading to suboptimal model accuracy.
  - Gradient Clipping: Existing techniques for efficient gradient clipping are not compatible with the standard Transformer architecture due to embedding sharing.
- **Eperimental Results:**
  - Re-Attention Mechanism: This mechanism mitigates attention distraction by tracking the variance of each layer's output distribution during forward propagation.
  The Re-Attention Mechanism consistently improves training stability and convergence, especially on imbalanced datasets.
  - Phantom Clipping: This technique enables efficient gradient clipping for Transformers with embedding sharing, generalizing existing methods.
  Phantom Clipping significantly improves memory efficiency and training speed compared to existing methods.

- **Conclusion:** The authors demonstrate that their modular approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of training DP Transformers. The proposed solutions, Re-Attention Mechanism and Phantom Clipping, contribute to advancing research in differentially private deep learning.

### Title: Guiding Text-to-Text Privatization by Syntax

- **Citation:** Arnold, Stefan, Dilara Yesilbas, and Sven Weinzierl. "Guiding text-to-text privatization by syntax." arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.01471 (2023).
- **Author(s):** Stefan Arnold, Dilara Yesilbas, Sven Weinzierl
- **Publication Year:** 2023
- **Summary:** The paper discusses advancements in text-to-text privatization using Metric Differential Privacy, focusing on enhancing user privacy while maintaining the grammatical integrity of the text. Traditional methods of anonymizing text data often fail to preserve the syntactic roles of words, resulting in incoherent outputs primarily composed of nouns.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Text-to-text privatization methods based on metric differential privacy often fail to preserve the grammatical properties of words after substitution.
  - The MADLIB mechanism, which operates on word embeddings, tends to produce surrogate texts dominated by nouns.
  - The authors propose a modification to MADLIB that incorporates grammatical categories into the candidate selection process.
  - This modification significantly improves the preservation of grammatical categories in surrogate texts.
  - The authors demonstrate that their modified mechanism achieves better performance in downstream tasks while maintaining comparable privacy guarantees.
  - The paper highlights the potential of incorporating grammatical properties into text-to-text privatization to enhance the utility of surrogate texts.
  - The authors acknowledge the need for further research to address the information leakage associated with their modification.
- **Conclusion:** In conclusion, the research demonstrates that integrating grammatical properties into text-to-text privatization can significantly enhance both privacy and utility. While prior studies primarily focused on geometric properties, this work highlights the importance of linguistic features in maintaining the quality of privatized texts. Despite potential risks of information leakage, the authors argue that their method represents a step forward in balancing privacy concerns with the need for coherent, contextually relevant text outputs. Future work could explore refining the candidate selection process to further mitigate privacy risks.

- **Publication Year:** 2021
- **Summary:** This paper explores the pretraining of BERT-Large using Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). The authors address the challenges of training large language models with differential privacy, which is crucial for protecting user data privacy.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Negative Interaction of Naive DP-SGD with Scale-Invariant Layers: The authors highlight the importance of a large weight decay parameter in the Adam optimizer to handle scale-invariant layers, which are common in BERT-Large. This insight helps in tuning hyper-parameters effectively to achieve higher accuracy.

This approach achieves a masked language model (MLM) accuracy of 60.5% at a batch size of 2 million, compared to the non-private BERT models' accuracy of around 70%.

  - Increasing Batch Size Schedule: The authors propose an increasing batch size schedule that improves training efficiency while maintaining accuracy. This schedule is motivated by the observation that the gradient signal-to-noise ratio (gradient-SNR) decreases over time, and increasing the batch size helps mitigate this issue.
- **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper establishes a high-accuracy baseline for DP BERT-Large pretraining and provides valuable insights into the practical challenges and solutions for training large language models with differential privacy.

- **Publication Year:** 2022
- **Summary:** This paper presents a method for generating synthetic customer feedback data with differential privacy guarantees. The authors propose fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (LM) with differential privacy (DP) to generate synthetic text that preserves the statistical properties of the original data while protecting individual privacy.
- **Key Findings:**
  - High Utility: The synthetic data generated using this method achieves comparable performance to non-private synthetic data and even outperforms models trained directly on the original data with DP in some cases.
  - Strong Privacy Protection: The DP-trained LM effectively prevents the leakage of private information, even when sensitive information is repeated multiple times in the training data.
  - Length Truncation Effect: The synthetic data generated with DP tends to be shorter than the original data, which is a limitation of the method.
  - Real-World Application: The authors demonstrate the feasibility of their approach using a private customer feedback dataset obtained from Microsoft.
- **Advantages of the Method:**
  - Flexibility: The method can be used to generate synthetic data for a variety of downstream tasks without incurring additional privacy loss.
  - Dataset Debugging: Synthetic data can be shared more freely, making it easier to debug datasets.
  - Data Retention: Synthetic data can be retained for longer periods under certain policies, as it does not directly contain private information.
- **Limitations:**
  - Tail of the Distribution: DP limits the model's ability to learn the tail of the data distribution, potentially missing valuable information conveyed in outliers.
  - Class Imbalance: DP disproportionately affects classes with different sample sizes, particularly impacting the learning of small-size classes.
  - Correlation: DP guarantees are most effective when individual samples have low or no correlation.

- **Key Findings:**
  - Simple Encryption: TextHide employs a simple encryption step using one-time secret keys to hide the representations of text data.
  - Minimal Impact: The encryption step is efficient and only slightly affects task performance.
  - Compatibility with BERT: TextHide seamlessly integrates with the popular framework of fine-tuning pre-trained language models like BERT.
  - Security Argument: TextHide's security relies on the computational intractability of a mathematical problem, k-VECTOR SUBSET SUM.
- **Eperimental Results:**
  - Accuracy: TextHide achieves comparable accuracy to the baseline BERT model, with an average accuracy reduction of only 1.9%.
  - Gradient Security: TextHide effectively defends against gradient-matching attacks, which aim to recover private inputs from shared gradients.
  - Representation Security: TextHide effectively hides the original representations of text data, making it difficult for attackers to reconstruct them.
- **Comparison to Existing Methods:**
  - Differential Privacy: While effective, differential privacy methods often trade off data utility for privacy preservation.
  - Cryptographic Methods: Homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation offer strong privacy guarantees but significantly slow down computations.
  - InstaHide: TextHide builds upon the InstaHide framework, which was originally designed for computer vision tasks.

- **Publication Year:** 2023
- **Summary:** Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are often deployed as cloud services, enabling users to upload textual data and perform inference remotely. However, this practice raises privacy concerns as users' personal text may contain sensitive information. To address this issue, the authors propose TextMixer, a novel privacy-preserving inference framework that prevents plaintext leakage during the inference phase.
- **TextMixer's key features:**
  - Mixing: TextMixer obfuscates a user's private input by mixing it with multiple other inputs, thereby confounding potential privacy attackers.
  - Encryption: The framework employs a Privacy Mixer module that encrypts input from three distinct dimensions: mixing, representation, and position.
  - Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) Network: A pre-trained MIMO network handles mixed representations and obtains multiple predictions.
  - Privacy Demixer: Only the user can decrypt the real output among the multiple predictions using a Privacy Demixer.
- **TextMixer's advantages:**
  - Enhanced Privacy: TextMixer significantly surpasses existing privacy-preserving methods in both performance and privacy.
  - Minimal Performance Degradation: The framework preserves the privacy of both the input and prediction while maintaining high task performance.
  - Flexibility: TextMixer supports both token-level and sentence-level classification tasks and allows users to switch synthetic input generation methods without retraining.
- **Conclusion:** TextMixer offers a promising solution for privacy-preserving inference in PLM services, effectively balancing privacy protection and task performance.
